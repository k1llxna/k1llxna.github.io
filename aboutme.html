											Welcome! I pursued a career in the games industry because I love being part of teams that bring so many people together through the games they develop. Games have always been a prevalent part of my life ever since I was little. Many of my friendships and even mindset were formed or strengthened through the medium of gaming; be it playing games with others, or even simply discussing game features and mechanics we're playing. Games bring hundreds, thousands, even millions of people together, and being a part of that is a truly magical thing. 
											I want to understand how games are created and designed from a mechanical & systematic point of view, to understand why games are fun, competitative, and relaxing. </p>
										<p>	
											When it comes to Game Design, I believe is less about Design and more about the mental process on implementing mechanics and how it will mold the game and it's system as a whole. Every subtle mechanic and feature is implemented for a reason!</p>

											<p>
												To me, coding is the core of a game obviously. However, the structure and finesse of a games code will determine not only its playability, but its efficiency and overall potential in implementing all intended features to maximize game content and player satisfaction.
